# Sortes

> By Externality Labs

Sortes is positioned as a groundbreaking, non-profit, trustless social welfare system built on decentralized principles. \
\
It reimagines traditional lottery and charitable models by replacing centralized control with transparent, on-chain processes.\
\
Sortes aims to democratize social welfare by leveraging blockchain technology to create a fair and transparent lottery system. The system:

* **Is non-profit and trustless:** All operations—from fund collection to prize distribution—are executed without a central authority.
* **Empowers users:** Participants not only have a chance to win but also contribute directly to charitable causes.
* **Is built on established blockchain protocols:** It uses Ethereum smart contracts and advanced cryptographic methods (like VRF/VDF) to ensure true randomness and fairness.

“Sortes” means fate in ancient Rome. By building this, we hope that everyone can take hold of their own destiny.
